# YOLO Dataset Configuration Example
# This file defines the structure of your dataset

# Dataset root directory (can be absolute or relative to this file)
path: /path/to/your/dataset

# Dataset splits (relative to 'path')
# Images should be in these directories
# Labels should be in parallel directories with 'images' replaced by 'labels'
# Example:
#   images/train/image1.jpg -> labels/train/image1.txt
#   images/val/image1.jpg   -> labels/val/image1.txt
train: images/train
val: images/val
test: images/test  # optional

# Number of classes
nc: 80
